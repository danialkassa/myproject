## **Step 7: Simple Parameter Design Practice**

- First of all go to Modify section and click on change parameters.

![Alt text](p1.png)

- Then click on this Add Button to add parameters.

![Alt text](p2.png)

- Now type the name for your parameter and give the expression or value and click ok. In this way you can add parameters.

![Alt text](p3.png)

- These are the parameters that i added to use it for my design.

![Alt text](p4.png)

- Now i selected the plane and use circle command to make my design.

![Alt text](p5.png)

![Alt text](p6.png)

- Now give the dimension by using parameter feature.

![Alt text](p7.png)

- I have added these 2 circles with the use of parameters and in this design second circle is linked with first one. If we change the expression or value of first one the dimension of the second circle will also be changed.

![Alt text](p8.png)

- Now i have used extrude command in create section.

![Alt text](p9.png)

![Alt text](p10.png)

- As i said earlier if we change the expression of our first parameter then the second one will also be changed because i used [Firstglad - Number] in expression of the second one.

![Alt text](p11.png)

- So as i changed 70mm into 50 then the secondglad which is 54mm changed to 34mm automatically.

![Alt text](p12.png)

- Now our final design also changed as we changed the parameters.

![Alt text](p13.png)

![Alt text](p14.png)

### **Use of Parameters in Our Design Model**

- First go to Modify section and click on change parameters.

![](<pr 1.png>)

![](<pr 2.png>)

- Now here you will find your model parameters so you can change them directly from here.

![](<pr 3.png>)

- Here you will see your component parameters. So we selected base to change its lenght.

![](<pr 4.png>)

![](<pr 5.png>)

- After changing the dimensions click Ok.

![](<pr 6.png>)

![](<pr 7.png>)

- So you can change any of your design component parameters (also angle degree dimensions).

![](<pr 8.png>)

![](<pr 9.png>)

- Now here we will change the vice jaw dimensions.

![](<pr 10.png>)

![](<pr 11.png>)

- After changing dimensions click ok, then you will see the results.

![](<pr 12.jpg>)

- As we have changed the dimensions of vice jaw so now you can see the difference clearly. So in this way we can change our design parameters easily.

![](<pr 13.jpg>)


## **Step 8: Practice for Automated Modeling (New Model)**

- We choose Cam Shaft Assembly designed by Shahar Yar for automated Modeling.
  
  ![Alt text](<Screenshot (421).png>)

  - First of all for automated modeling go to Automate section and click on it.

  ![Alt text](<Screenshot (421)-1.png>)

- Now Select faces that you want to connect to create new body or component for your model.
- ![Alt text](<Screenshot (424).png>)

  - After selecting faces to connect now select bodies that you want to avoid and click on generate shapes.

![Alt text](<Screenshot (425).png>)

  - Now select any shape that you like and click on Ok.

![Alt text](<Screenshot (426).png>)

![Alt text](<Screenshot (427).png>)

- Now go to your new body that you have created and right click on it and select Isolate.

![Alt text](<Screenshot (428).png>)

![Alt text](<Screenshot (429).png>)

- Here is the final design by using automate feature of Fusion 360.
