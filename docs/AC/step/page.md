## How To Develop the website

## A: Installing necessary Tools

` `We installed all the following tools to build the website

\- [Git](https://git-scm.com); It serves as a control system for tracking changes to the code base, collaborating, managing project versions, which allows us to clone, commit, and push changes to GitHub。

\- [Github](https://about.gitlab.com/);This is where our web page is hosted.

\- [Github desktop](https://www.gitbook.com/);Since it is a user-friendly GUI application, we use it to streamline our Git workflow, allowing us to easily clone, commit, and sync repositories.

\- [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/); We enhanced our web development workflow with this versatile and customizable tool.

\- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/);  Since the tool includes NPM, we used it to manage packages, interact with the command line, and integrate with VScode

\- [Markdown language](https://www.nexmaker.com/doc/1projectmanage/markdown.html); This language helps us format plain text by creating headings, lists, links, images, and emphasis.

## B: Set up the page

` `We visited the GitHub website (https://github.com) and registered a new account, login. 

 <br>
<img style="float: center;" width=100% src="image/login.jpg">
<br>
<br>
Once logged in, we click the "+" button in the upper right corner of the GitHub homepage and select "New Repository.
<br>
<br>
<img style="float: center;" width=100% src="image/plus.jpg">
<br>
<br>
Then we gave it a name (Team-Gladiators) being in the admin's account and selected whether it should be public or private. Then, after enabling the readme, click create repository.
<br>
<br>
<img style="float: center;" width=100% src="image/merge.jpg">
<br>
<br>
Then after, Go to setting located at the upper left side of Github homepage, then pages, go to main, enable root, save. 
<br>
<br>
<img style="float: center;" width=100% src="image/link.jpg">

## C: Local setup

### 1. Github Desktop

In GitHub Desktop, we go to Files and Clone Repository.
After selecting the repository to clone, We selected the directory to save the cloned repository. Then we click "Clone" to start the cloning process. Once the cloning is complete, we navigate to the location of the cloned repository.
<br>
<br>

<img style="float: center;" width=100% src="image/gi.jpg">

<br>
<img style="float: center;" width=100% src="image/clone.jpg">
<br>
<br>
We painted the VS code with red color to show that after installing vs code, we open it to start writing our documents.

<img style="float: center;" width=100% src="image/installingdocsify.jpg">
<br>

 We then initialize it by typing “docsify init./docs” in the terminal command and hit enter so that Docsify creates the necessary files and folders in the specified directory.

  <br>
<img style="float: center;" width=100% src="image/initialize.jpg">

  We then type "docsify serve docs" into the command terminal to instruct Docsify to serve the documentation site. We open it in the browser by clicking CTRL + "https://losthost:3000".

      -We open the index file and go to window. .$docsify and then add
              loadSidebar: true,

 - Collapsible sidebar
To make the sidebar collapsible,we just need to add this code in window.$docsify


             subMaxLevel: 3,
             sidebarDisplayLevel: 1, // Set sidebar display level

Then insert the script into the document, just like the official plugin usage

              <!-- plugins -->
               <script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/docsify-sidebar-collapse/dist/docsify-sidebar-collapse.min.js"></script>

      <!--docs/_navbar.md -->
             - [HOME](home.md)
             - [MEMBERS](INTRO/NAVBAR/member.md)

Open the index file go to window.$docsify and add

             loadNavbar: true,


  ### 6. Upload Image

 We created an image folder in the document to store all the pictures.

A folder named "Image" is created in a directory named "docs". The purpose of this folder is to store all pictures or images related to a specific assignment or document.

Then we drag and drop them into the document.

We find the required image file in the images folder and drag it to the document we are working on. This action places the image at the desired location in the document.


    "...use 'img style="float: center;" width=100% src="IMAGE/nameof ourimage.png/jpg" format.'"

This section describes how to use the HTML <img> tag to insert images into a document.

 style="float: center;":
This attribute sets the float property of the image to "center", which means that the image will be centered horizontally within its containing element.

    width=100%:
 This attribute sets the width of the image to 100% pixels. This determines the visual size of the image in the document.

    src="image/foldr name.png": 
This attribute specifies the source of the image (src). In this case, it points to a file called "name of our image.png/jpg" located in the "image" folder. The path "name of our image.png/jpg" means that the image folder is located in the current directory, and the image file name is

    "name of our image.png/jpg".

Format: "Format" seems to be mentioned, but has no specific meaning in this context. It may be included as a placeholder or for other purposes, but it does not affect the image insertion itself.

In short, we describe the process of creating an image folder to store pictures. Then, add these pictures to our document by dragging and dropping them where we want. Images are inserted using the HTML <img> tag, which has specific properties to control its appearance, including alignment, size, and source.

### 7. Set up  Members

 <img style="float: center;" width=100% src="image/mm.jpg">
 <br>
<br>

First we downloaded the "saveallresourse" tool and addded to the chrome extention. 
The "saveallresource" saves all the files and assets of any website. It downloads resources like HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, images, and more, preserving the folder structure. The tool helped us to quickly gather and preserve all necessary website files.

Here is the code to display the Members.

### 8. Prepare and save documents In Vs Code

<br>
In Summary,To prepare and save documents in VS Code:
<br>Open VS Code.
<br><br>Create a new file or open an existing one.
<br><br>Edit the document.
<br><br>To save, go to "File" > "Save" or use Ctrl+S (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+S (Mac).
<br><br>To save with a different name or location, use "Save As" (Ctrl+Shift+S or Cmd+Shift+S).
<br><br>To save all open files, use "Save All" (Ctrl+K S or Cmd+K S).
<br><br>Consider using Auto Save for automatic saving (configure in "File" > "Auto Save"). 

<br>The whole Picture of docs file in VS code looks like this.

<br>

### 9: Upload files

<br>
  1. We established a connection between our local repository and the GitHub repository.
We commit and push the file to GitHub:

To upload our web files to GitHub, we used the command “push commits to the origin remote”.
The “push” command sends committed changes from our local repository to the GitHub repository.

 <br>

 <br>
<img style="float: center;" width=100% src="image/push.jpg">
  <br>
   
<br>
 2. To publish our web page, we look for the settings for our GitHub repository. Then scroll down to the GitHub Pages section and select the branch that contains our web files.
We select the folder or root directory where the web page file is located.
Then click the "Save" or "Update" button to apply the changes.
GitHub generates a URL for our published web page that we can share and access publicly. We can see this process as follows.

    Installing Tools to build the website:

    -[Git](https://git-scm.com); It serves as a control system for tracking changes to the code base, collaborating, managing project versions, which allows us to clone, commit, and push changes to GitHub。
    - [Github](https://about.gitlab.com/);This is where our web page is hosted.
    - [Github desktop](https://www.gitbook.com/);Since it is a user-friendly GUI application, we use it to streamline our Git workflow, allowing us to easily clone, commit, and sync repositories.
    - [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/); We enhanced our web development workflow with this versatile and customizable tool.
    - [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/);  Since the tool includes NPM, we used it to manage packages, interact with the command line, and integrate with VScode
    - [Markdown language](https://www.nexmaker.com/doc/1projectmanage/markdown.html); This language helps us format plain text by creating headings, lists, links, images, and emphasis.<br>
