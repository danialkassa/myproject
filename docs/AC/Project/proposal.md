### WiFi-Controlled Light, Door, and Fan for People with Mobility Disability Using Web Interface Control
#### Introduction
This project aims to develop WiFi-controlled solutions for lights, doors, and fans specifically designed to address the unique needs of disabled individuals. By leveraging WiFi technology and incorporating accessibility features, we provided innovative solutions that enhance independence, convenience, and comfort for disabled individuals.
### Literature Review
Before we started doing our final project,we have tried to conduct thorough researchs on recently published articles, forums and websites. Here are some of the websites which are relevant to our project.
#### The integration of smart home technology:
The integration of smart home technology has been a game-changer for individuals with disabilities, particularly those with mobility challenges. The ability to control various aspects of one's environment through a web interface can significantly enhance independence and quality of life. This report synthesizes key points from recent sources to explore the benefits and considerations of using WiFi-controlled lights, doors, and fans for individuals with mobility disabilities.

#### Accessibility and the ADA:
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) emphasizes the importance of accessible web content for people with disabilities. Inaccessible web features can prevent equal access to information and services . The ADA applies to public entities and businesses, which have the flexibility to choose how to make their online services accessible. Technical standards such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and Section 508 Standards offer guidance on ensuring web accessibility [(1)](https://www.ada.gov/resources/web-guidance/#:~:text=Inaccessible%20web%20content%20means%20that%20people%20with%20disabilities%20are%20denied%20equal%20access%20to%20information).

#### Smart Home Technology for Disabled Individuals:
Smart home devices have revolutionized living spaces, enhancing convenience and quality of life for disabled individuals. These technologies prioritize accessibility and independence, assisting with safety, daily activities, and communication . They can also integrate with healthcare systems for emergencies . A central control hub, typically an app or voice assistant, allows for remote management of smart devices [(2)](https://www.ecovacs.com/us/blog/smart-home-devices-disabled-persons).

#### Enhancing Independence with Smart Home Devices
Smart home technology can empower individuals with disabilities to live more independently by simplifying everyday tasks such as turning on lights, opening doors, or adjusting fans . These devices can provide notifications, remote access control, and hands-free operation through integration with other devices . The setup process is generally straightforward, using a smartphone and an app . Smart home devices not only offer independence but can also lead to energy savings and a more comfortable living environment [(3)](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-assistive-smart-home-technology-for-disabled/).
### What problems are we solving?

According to our review, voice controlled light and door system doesn't secure individual's  **privacy concern and potential disturbance**. Thus, we decided to develop  a project with a **web-based control interface**, providing a discreet and personalized **alternative** to voice controlled system. While voice control is a common method for web navigation and device control, it may not be universally suitable due to privacy considerations or the potential to disrupt others. The proposed web interface control is an ideal solution to addresses these concerns, offering an independence,accessibility and  a customizable solution tailored to the user's individual needs.

#### C: Programming Used
**C++**

C++ is used as the programming language for the microcontroller firmware. The C++ code controls the ESP8266 module, handles HTTP requests, and interacts with the hardware components such as the servo motor, LED, and fan. It sets up the web server, defines request handlers, and performs the desired actions based on the incoming requests. C++ is commonly used for low-level programming tasks and is well-suited for embedded systems.

**HTML**:

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used for creating the web page that allows users to interact with the microcontroller. In the code, HTML is embedded within the C++ code as strings. The HTML code defines the structure, layout, and content of the web page. It includes buttons to control the LED, servo motor (door), and fan. When a user interacts with the buttons, HTTP requests are sent to the microcontroller to perform the requested actions.

**JAVASCRIPT**

JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the web page. In the code, JavaScript code is embedded within the HTML code as inline scripts. JavaScript is responsible for handling button clicks and sending HTTP requests to the microcontroller. When a user clicks a button, the JavaScript code triggers an HTTP request with the appropriate command to control the microcontroller. It enables the web page to dynamically update and communicate with the microcontroller in real-time.

In summary, C++ is used for the microcontroller firmware and handling HTTP requests, HTML is used for creating the web page structure and content, and JavaScript is used for adding interactivity to the web page and sending HTTP requests to control the microcontroller.
