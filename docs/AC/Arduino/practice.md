  <h1 style="font-size:1.7vw"><span style="color:black">A. Introduction to Arduino</span></h1>
Arduino is a prototyping platform (open source) based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It consists of a programmable circuit board called a microcontroller and off-the-shelf software called the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for writing and uploading computer code to the physical board.
<h1 style="font-size:1.7vw"><span style="color:black">B. The main features of Arduino:</span></h1>
The Arduino board is able to read analog or digital input signals from different sensors and convert them into outputs such as activating motors, turning on/off LEDs, connecting to the cloud and many other operations.

You can control board functions by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board through the Arduino IDE (upload software for short).

Unlike most previous programmable circuit boards, Arduino does not require additional hardware (called a programmer) to load new code onto the board. You just use a USB cable.

Additionally, the Arduino IDE uses a simplified version of C++, making it easier to learn programming.

Finally, Arduino offers a standard form factor that breaks the functionality of a microcontroller into easier-to-use packages

  }
}
```
<b>Here is line by line discription:</b>

    const int LED1 = 12;
    const int LED2 = 13;
    int val = 0;
This declares two constants, LED1 and LED2, with values 12 and 13 respectively. These constants represent the pin numbers of two LEDs.
the last variable declares an integer variable val and initializes it to 0.

    void setup()
    { 
    pinMode(LED1, OUTPUT); pin refers the firt coordinate whereas Mode points the second coordinate
    pinMode(LED2, OUTPUT);
    pinMode(7, INPUT);}
Begins the setup() function, which is a standard Arduino function that is called once when the microcontroller starts.
Sets LED1 and LED2 pins as output using pinMode() function.
Sets pin 7 as an input pin using pinMode() function.

    void loop (){
        val = digitalRead(7);
        if (val == HIGH)
        {
        digitalWrite(LED1, HIGH);
        digitalWrite(LED2, LOW);
        }
        else
        {
        digitalWrite(LED2, HIGH);
        digitalWrite(LED1, LOW);
        }
        delay(1000);
    }
Begins the loop() function, which is a standard Arduino function that runs repeatedly after the setup() function.
Reads the value from pin 7 and stores it in the val variable using the digitalRead() function.
Checks if val is equal to HIGH.
If true, it turns on LED1 by setting its pin to HIGH and turns off LED2 by setting its pin to LOW.
If false, it turns on LED2 by setting its pin to HIGH and turns off LED1 by setting its pin to LOW.
Delays the execution of the code for 1000 milliseconds (1 second) using the delay() function.

    }
Defines a function named readUltrasonicDistance that takes two integer parameters: triggerPin and echoPin.
<br>Inside the function, it sets the triggerPin as an output pin, clears the trigger by setting it to low, waits for 2 microseconds, then sets the trigger pin to a high state for 10 microseconds before setting it back to low.
<br>It sets the echoPin as an input pin.
<br>It uses the pulseIn() function to read the echo pin and returns the sound wave travel time in microseconds.

<b>Description of the code</b>
<br> It defines some variables, including the number of LEDs (ledCount), the number of segments (segCount), and an array of LED pins (ledPins) and segment pins (segPins).
<br>There is also an array called dofly_DuanMa that holds hexadecimal values representing patterns for displaying numbers on a 7-segment display.
<br>In the setup() function, it sets the defined pins as outputs using pinMode().
<br>The deal() function is used to write values to the LED pins based on the provided value parameter.
<br>In the loop() function, it increments a counter (num) every second and updates the displayTemp array with specific values from dofly_DuanMa.
<br>The code then cycles through the segment pins and displays the corresponding value from displayTemp on the 7-segment display.
<br>The cycle repeats continuously in the loop() function.
