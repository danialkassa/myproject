**HISTORY OF 3D PRINTING**

The history of 3D printing began in 1981 with Dr. Hideo Kodama's invention of a rapid prototyping machine using UV-polymerized resin. Chuck Hull, credited as the "inventor of 3D printing," filed the first patent for stereolithography (SLA) in 1986, introducing the .stl file format commonly used in 3D printing. In 1988, Carl Deckard licensed selective laser sintering (SLS), and in 1989, Scott Crump patented fused deposition modelling (FDM), founding Stratasys. These milestones marked the emergence of various 3D printing technologies, laying the foundation for the industry's growth.

In the 1990s, the early 3D printing industry experienced significant growth, marked by the founding of new companies and the exploration of various additive manufacturing technologies. A noteworthy development occurred in 2006 when the first commercially available selective laser sintering (SLS) printer was introduced, indicating a milestone in the industry's evolution.

**New Research papers or publication** 

1. **Thomas, “3D printed jellyfish robots created to monitor fragile coral reefs,” *3D Printer and 3D Printing News*, 2018. [Online]. Available: <http://www.3ders.org/articles/20181003-3d-printed-jellyfish-robots-created-to-monitor-fragile-coral-reefs.html>. [ Accessed 2019].**

Scientists from [Florida Atlantic University](http://www.fau.edu/) (FAU) and the [US Office of Naval Research](https://www.onr.navy.mil/) have designed and created 3D printed soft robot jellyfish capable of monitoring fragile coral reefs.

Soft robots have tremendous potential to explore and monitor delicate marine ecosystems like coral reefs without causing unintentional damage to fragile objects.

The jellyfish robot navigating through the ocean.

According to Dr. Erik Engeberg, Associate Professor at the Department of Ocean and Mechanical Engineering, FAU, the study of fragile aquatic environments has always been challenging for marine researchers. Coral reefs, in particular, are important to monitor as they provide habitats and shelter for various marine organisms.

Thus, the team of researchers, recognizing the excellent swimming capabilities of the jellyfish, have developed five unique soft robots capable of maneuvering “untethered in the ocean, squeezing through orifices more narrow than the nominal diameter of the jellyfish, and steering from side to side.”

The jellyfish robots maintain a 3D printed body with eight soft hydraulic network actuators extending from the center, similar to the form of a moon jellyfish. These actuators were chosen to minimize inadvertent damage to fragile biological systems. The study explains, “live jellyfish essentially have neutral buoyancy, so water was chosen as the medium to inflate the hydraulic network actuators while freely swimming in the ocean, pool, or aquarium.”

The researchers designed mold models for the jellyfish robot in [SolidWorks ](https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/took-solidworks-training-course-solid-solutions-132740/)and subsequently 3D printed with an Ultimaker 2 using PLA. “Each tentacle had a common channel extending radially outward from the center of the robot; four of these channels were connected on each side of the jellyfish so that four tentacles could be driven by a single impeller pump,” the study states.  Furthermore, two pumps were used to actuate the eight tentacles.

The tentacle actuators and segmented flap molds which made the body of the jellyfish robot was then filled with silicon rubber. A cylindrical housing for the jellyfish microcontroller and electronics was also 3D printed out with ABS using an [Axiom AirWolf](https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/airwolf-3ds-axiom-3d-printer-gets-a-dual-head-upgrade-65612/) 3D printer.

Dr. Engeberg added: “We found the robots were able to swim through openings narrower than the nominal diameter of the robot. In the future, we plan to incorporate environmental sensors like sonar into the robot’s control algorithm, along with a navigational algorithm. This will enable it to find gaps and determine if it can swim through them.”

Their [**findings**](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-3190/aadcb3/meta) were published in the journal Bioinspiration and Biomimetics.

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">1. What is 3D printing?</span></span></p>
<p>3D printing is also known as desktop fabrication or additive manufacturing. It is a prototyping process whereby a real object is created from a 3D design. The digital 3D-model is saved in STL format and then sent to a 3D printer. The 3D printer then prints the design layer by layer and forms a real object. <a href="./3d-printing.html" target="_blank">Read more..</a></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. 3D printing technologies</span></span></p>
<p>There are several different 3D printing technologies. The main differences are how layers are built to create parts. </p>
<p>SLS (selective laser sintering), FDM (fused deposition modeling) &amp; SLA (stereolithograhpy) are the most widely used technologies for 3D printing. Selective laser sintering (SLS) and fused deposition modeling (FDM) use melted or softened materials to produce layers. </p>
<p>This video describes how laser-sintering processes melt fine powders, bit by bit, into 3D shapes.</p>

<P>Designed by Continuum Fashion, the N12 if the first completely 3D-printed, ready-to-wear, item of clothing. Previous experiments into the use of 3D printing in clothing have remained purely experimental, haute couture items not available to purchase. This represents the first affordable design that will lead the way for more items fabricated using 3D printing technologies.
“The bikini’s design fundamentally reflects the beautiful intricacy possible with 3D printing, as well as the technical challenges of creating a flexible surface out of the solid nylon. Thousands of circular plates are connected by thin springs, creating a wholly new material that holds its form as well as being flexible. The layout of the circle pattern was achieved through custom written code that lays out the circles according to the curvature of the surface. In this way, the aesthetic design is completely derived from the structural design.” Mary Haung, Continuum Fashion
The N12 is named after Nylon 12 (WSF), the material in which the bikini is 3D printed.  Nylon 12 makes an ideal swimsuit material as it is innately waterproof. As well as being the first 3D printed bikini, it is also the first bikini that actually becomes more comfortable when it gets wet.
The N12 was designed using Rhino 3D CAD software and specially written algorithmic script to create the structure of the 3D printed fabric. The algorithm uses a complex ‘circle packing’ equation on an arbitrarily doubly curved surface (the bikini). The size of the circles responds to curvature and edge conditions of the form, creating smooth edges and a responsive pattern <a href="https://printmediacentr.com/worlds-first-3d-printed-bikini-makes-debut/" target="_blank">Read more..</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">5. What is a 3D printer?</span></span></p>
<p>A 3D printer is unlike your standard, 2D inkjet printer. On a 3D printer the object is printed in three dimensions. A 3D model is built up layer by layer. Therefore the whole process is called rapid prototyping, or 3D printing. <a href="./3d-printer.html" target="_blank">Read more..</a></p>
<p>The resolution of the current printers is around 328 x 328 x 606 DPI (xyz) at 656 x 656 x 800 DPI (xyz) in ultra-HD resolution. The accuracy is 0.025 mm - 0.05 mm per inch. The model size is up to 737 mm x 1257 mm x 1504 mm.<br /></p>
<p>The biggest drawback for the individual home user is still the high <a href="./3d-printer/3d-printer-price.html" target="_blank">cost of 3D printer</a>. Another drawback is that it takes hours or even days to print a 3D model (depending on the complexity and resolution of the model). Besides above, the professional 3D software and 3D model design is also in a high cost range. </p>
<p>Alternatively there are already simplified 3D printers for hobbyist which are much cheaper. And the materials it uses is also less expensive. These <a href="./3d-printer/who-make-3d-printers.html" target="_blank">3D printers for home use</a> are not as accurate as <a href="./3d-printer/who-make-3d-printers.html" target="_blank">commercial 3D printer</a>.  </p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">6. Whats the difference between a basic rapid prototyping machine and a 3D printer?</span></span></p>
<p>3D printers are the simple version of rapid prototyping machines. It is lower lost and less capable. </p>
<p>Rapid prototyping is a conventional method that has been used by automotive and aircraft industries for years.</p>
<p>In general 3D printers are compact and smaller than RP machines. They are ideal for use in offices. They use less energy and take less space. They are designed for low volume reproduction of real objects made of nylon or other plastics. That also means 3D printers make smaller parts. Rapid prototyping machines have build chambers at least 10 inches on a side, a 3D printer has less than 8 inches on a side. However a 3D printer is capable of all the functions of rapid prototyping machine such as verifying and validating design, creating prototype, remote sharing of information etc.<br />
<br />
Consequently 3D printers are easy to handle and cheap to maintain. You can buy one of those DIY kit in the market and build up yourself. It is cheaper than the professional rapid prototyping, for $1000 or less you can have one 3D printer. While the professional rapid prototyping cost at least $50,000.<br />
<br />
3D printers are less accurate than rapid prototyping machines. Because of its simplicity the material choices are also limited.<br /></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">7. What can you make with a 3D printer?</span></span></p>
<p>In 3D printing area, people say "If You Can Draw It, You Can Make It". In the video below shows many items can be made with a 3D printer. However complicated objects can only be made by professional 3D printers, they are not yet affortable for common family. </p>

**Theory on GCODE**

**1. Basic Syntax:**

- G-code commands consist of letters and numbers.
- Letters represent different actions, such as movement or tool changes.
- Numbers provide parameters for those actions.
- For example, G00 is a rapid positioning command, and G01 is a linear interpolation command.

**2. Common G-code Commands:**

- **G00/G01:** Rapid positioning/Linear interpolation.
- **G02/G03:** Circular interpolation (clockwise/counter clockwise).
- **G20/G21:** Set units to inches/millimetres.
- **G90/G91:** Set to absolute/incremental positioning.
- **M03/M05:** Start/stop spindle rotation.
- **M08/M09:** Coolant on/off.

**3. Axis Codes:**

- G-code commands often include axis codes to specify which axis is being referred to.
- X, Y, Z are common for three-axis machines.
- A, B, C are used for rotational axes.

**4. Parameters:**

- Parameters follow G-codes and provide specific details.
- For example, in G01 X1.0 Y2.0, X1.0 and Y2.0 are parameters indicating the destination coordinates.

**5. Comments:**

- Comments start with a semicolon (;) and are ignored by the machine. They are useful for adding human-readable notes to the code.

**6. Programming Workflow:**

- G-code is typically generated by CAM software based on a 3D model.
- The generated G-code is then transferred to the CNC machine's controller.
- The machine reads and executes the instructions, producing the desired part.

**7. Safety Considerations:**

- Understanding the machine's capabilities and limitations is crucial to avoid errors or accidents.
- Machinists should be familiar with emergency stop commands (e.g., M00 or M01).

**8. Customization:**

- G-code can be customized for specific applications or machines.
- Macro programming (using M98 and M99) allows the inclusion of subprograms.

**9. Simulation and Verification:**

- Before running G-code on a physical machine, it's often simulated to catch errors and ensure correct toolpaths.

**10. Post-Processing:**

- Post-processors convert CAM-generated toolpaths into machine-specific G-code.

**11. 3D Printing:**

- G-code is widely used in 3D printing to control the movement of the print head and bed, as well as extrusion parameters.

**Example G-code snippet:**

G00 X0 Y0 Z0           	; Rapid move to starting point

G01 X1 Y1 Z0 F10      	; Linear move to point (1, 1, 0) at a feed rate of 10 units/minute

M03 S1000               	; Start spindle at 1000 RPM

G02 X2 Y2 I1 J0        	; Clockwise circular move to point (2, 2) with a centre at (1, 0)

M05                    	; Stop spindle

It's important to note that specific G-codes and their meanings can vary between different CNC machines and controllers. Users should refer to their machine's documentation for accurate information.
